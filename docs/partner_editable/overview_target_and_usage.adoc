This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start builds a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for serverless .NET applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. It deploys an https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/[AWS CodeCommit] repository with a sample AWS Lambda application defined in an https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/[AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)] template. Pushing changes to modify the application invokes https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/[AWS CodePipeline]. The pipeline builds and deploys the application using AWS CloudFormation and exposes it to the internet with https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/[Amazon API Gateway].
